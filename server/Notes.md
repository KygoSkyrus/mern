- implement loader on every actions on front and admin both
- remove the box shadow from dropdons in navbar in mobile view

- need to add toast status on admin side and also at the server response
- check each and every categoryes..for example playstation is not showing up
- try creating utility function,, for like toast,,,instead of writing those 3 lines everywhere//settoaststatus,content and visibility are three action that wil be dispatched from multiple componnets ,,instead create a common function and call it
- when session exipred the wishlist page is not showing toast and also hide the loader if the session exppired and sghow to login
- grey out when products when they are out of stocks
- sticky navbar in admin dasboard
- image preview background

- add discount field for product which will be default to 0 and admin can set the discount whenever
- when new image is added,,refresh the list
- set isuserloggedin to false whenever session expired is returned bcz it needs to refersh to show the signin option back when expired while the app is running
- on every action like on adding prodcut pr deleeting ,,all repsonse from serever,,,add a notification for that response,,,let user now what has been done and then dont refresh the page,,,call the required api which will update the page
- if product has more than one image then its not uploading the other images on slow network,,its an issue

- maybe change the heading of related priduct base on which page they are
- add onscroll animations on homepage

# Defects
- add the profile image instad of prfole on both admin and user side
- remove the faded yellow and purple filler 


# TODO
- admin table heading should be sticky for mobile
- also check responsiveness betwwen 768-992
- clear unneccsary stuff

# Wouldn't hurt to have (least priority)
- when a order is completed than reduce the quantity of all the ordered products by the quanty they are bought
- add the part where user can add items to cart without logging in,,use cookies to store cart items
- there can be a cicrle or whatever button for feedback at the bottom right asking for feedback for users overall experienece
- add the new images in banner
- currently the categoyr page is breaking the Link chaain an reloading the appp
- add product from button and header is not looking good
- make the images for product go slide in slide no just disapper and display
- can add on hover cart show cart items with two option of view cart and checkout oprtion (there is sample layout url also below somewhere)
- table heading in admin can be sticky
- fix admin filter
- login with phone can be possible, but forsbase only provides 10 logins perday, 
- one backspaceing in otp inputs,,two digits are getting erased
- instead of showing toast message that"product is removed from cart or added" ,,add fhe product name
- can chnage toast design for user side( can make it more elegant)
- recipt url get expirewd after a period , maybe the recipt can be copied to a canvas or img and store in server(in testmode its not worth it to go through this much trouble)
- think about converting the navbar into a small cicle hovering and on click it expands and become the navbar (in other words OR - on scroll dont keep the nav fixed, instead make a minifide nav which will stay floated at the top)
- make the same loader for both admin and front...use logo,,and for admin just put a hat above the logo's top
  _product admin image upload_
- havee to add delete image from firestoreage when product is deleted
- add the feature where selected images to be uploaded can be unselected individually before uploaing and also after seecting other images can also be selected and should be appneded to the exisiting list
- when images are selected through inputs then for multiple images there should be an option to remove imgages
  _product admin image upload_
- initially only 3 reviews will be added in product schema,the rest will go to reviews table with the product id as key, so the tree reviews will be shown initailly and on cliccking view more the rest of reviews will be loaded from review table
- admin menubar will be like hanging from ;left or maybe circular at any corner,,,will have desktop where it will show all products categories,,,orders completed and orders in progress
- there should be two category options in product,category and subcategory,currently categoryes are actually sub categories, also tthis will be asked when Admin adds new product.
- right next to category on product add page there should be a button to add a new category

- we have to populat the ref field on signin and signup and also at getuserinfo//--not sure --->>and just call cart products and orders on their respective page,,cart ietms number badge number on navbar can be taken care by the cart length whihc is product id only>>>>the proble is aboout calling ten api to get cart order and wihslist on each page or keep them in app in advance from other actions,,which can be unneccesary though
  ------FINAL DECISON-- call the api on dedicated page ..on signin dont populate anithing...neither onget userdetails>>>>with this approach we wont need the getuseindo to send user indo also,,,ww will have the useefect on age in user component to gte user details,,,gthere might be somepage where we will need more than that,,for that we can eidt the getuseinfo to reurn bassic info like email and name after just checking the cookie presence>>>>>STILL NOT SURE ABOUT THIS,,,every render will call this dedicated api and it kinds of eleiminates redux and makes it like server side rendering

# CATEGORY [architecture]

- about subcategory,,in each categoyr documnet there shoudl be field 'subcategory',,and this subcategory-- this will help in to show the heirrachy of categories,,
- but the subcategoires will have their own document in categories collection and their sub will be empty
- these category and subcategory can have similar products
- in product document their will be a category
- the main thing to conclude every subcategory problem is that we will never show products on parent category(the topmost,,only when it is searched,,when searched will look for that word) ..we will only show the direct category ...

# order [architecture]

    - session is created,
    - it has session id annd the metadata
    - session id is mapped with orderid and saved in db
    - when payment is done then the page will redirect to order page with orderid in url
    - the order page can be openend two ways:::

    - order page will first query the order list (FIRST scenario) and if the order isnt found then it will chekc if there is a session for that order id (for SECOND scenario)

    - FIRST>>>when order is placed>>
        - on order page with the order id reterive the session id from db
        - with the session id the session can be reterived from stripe api and then in that session  id get the paymentIntent id and reterive that too for recipt url
        - get the necessary stuff from metadata and also check if the paymnet is success
        - if succeeded then save that in database,if failed then save in db with failed status,,,,,,
        - if no cation is taken then dont save and also delte that session and orderid from db,,,and show payment isnt completed bcz no action was taken

      - SECOND>>>when order is opened from orderList
        - if the order is visible in order list page ten it means it was saved ,,,its simple just get the order from db with order id

### forever notes

- you cannot just send an object in post reuqest as it would show [object] in backend as formdata does not accept object as a value, so always stringfy your object before posting
- avoid using foreach or callback loops when you have async process inside the loop
- when you have to put a stick position to a navabar or any element remember that the parent shoudl hav emore height than the element to be sticky and on sticky element give top properyty ,,only sticky wont do anything you need top,,
