### DEFECTS
- one backspaceing in otp inputs,,two digits are getting erased


### todo
- initially only 3 reviews will be added in product schema,the rest will go to reviews table with the product id as key, so the tree reviews will be shown initailly and on cliccking view more the rest of reviews will be loaded from review table
- admin menubar will be like hanging from ;left or maybe circular at any corner,,,will have desktop where it will show all products categories,,,orders completed and orders in progress 
- fort products dashboard refer to this 
[https://bs-5-jekyll-git-airframe-styleguide-tomaszowczarczyk.vercel.app/]products
-color and box shadow [https://codepen.io/animationbro/full/poLvzmE]
- menu hamburger icon [https://codepen.io/Vishal4225/pen/jOezoZj]
- on every action like on adding prodcut pr deleeting ,,all repsonse from serever,,,add a notification for that response,,,let user now what has been done and then dont refresh the page,,,call the required api which will update the page


### would be better to have
- on scroll dont keep the nav fixed, instead make a minifide nav which will stay floated at the top
- havee to add delete image from firestoreage when product is deleted 
- add the feature where selected images to be uploaded can be unselected individually before uploaing and also after seecting other images can also be selected and  should be appneded to the exisiting list
