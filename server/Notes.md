### todo
1. first complete the add product feature,,
2. delete product and diable product all stuff..all basic things that were in skyblog,,just copy
3. get rid of unecessary stuff
4. once all its done,,upload all the product with detials to the homepage can be designed

- finish homepage,,
- we dont need the image upload progress in here,,instead add a loader to shoup product add status

-add dark light option in admin

### DEFECTS
- one backspaceing in otp inputs,,two digits are getting erased





### Thoughts
- make the same loader for both admin and front...use logo,,and for admin just put a hat above the logo's top
- initially only 3 reviews will be added in product schema,the rest will go to reviews table with the product id as key, so the tree reviews will be shown initailly and on cliccking view more the rest of reviews will be loaded from review table
- admin menubar will be like hanging from ;left or maybe circular at any corner,,,will have desktop where it will show all products categories,,,orders completed and orders in progress 
- fort products dashboard refer to this 
[https://bs-5-jekyll-git-airframe-styleguide-tomaszowczarczyk.vercel.app/]products
-color and box shadow [https://codepen.io/animationbro/full/poLvzmE]
- menu hamburger icon [https://codepen.io/Vishal4225/pen/jOezoZj]
- on every action like on adding prodcut pr deleeting ,,all repsonse from serever,,,add a notification for that response,,,let user now what has been done and then dont refresh the page,,,call the required api which will update the page

- when any action gets complete then dont refresh the page just reload the stuff and show toast about the action 



### would be better to have
- on scroll dont keep the nav fixed, instead make a minifide nav which will stay floated at the top
- havee to add delete image from firestoreage when product is deleted 
- add the feature where selected images to be uploaded can be unselected individually before uploaing and also after seecting other images can also be selected and  should be appneded to the exisiting list
- when images are selected through inputs then for multiple images there should be an option to remove imgages
